# NYC_Bikesharing

## Overview of Analysis

The client is intereseted in establishing a bikesharing company in Des Moines, Iowa, and is looking for investors. They have requested an analysis of data from a bikesharing company in New York City to present to their potential investors. As part of this analysis, they have requested a story be created utilizing Tableau to really make their presentation stand out.

## Results

Using the provide dataset from the client, I was able to determine that the majority of riders take trips lasting less than 10 minutes.

A further analysis utilizing gender information reinforced the average trip duration and showed the majority of users of the bikesharing service are male.

In order to get a clearer picture of when bike usage is highest, three heat maps were created:

* The first shows usage for all by all users of the app and indicates the most active times are weekends and weekday rush hours, 7:00am-9:00am and 5:00pm-7:00pm.

* The second breaks the analysis down by gender and reiterates the earlier findings that the majority of users are male and the busiest times are weekends and rush hours.

* The final image compared the data of one-time customers and subscribers to the service. The heatmap shows that the majority of users are regular subscribers and reiterated the previous gender and usage findings.

## Summary

Based on the NYC data, I would strongly recommend establishing a bikesharing service in Des Moines. The majority of users are repeat, i.e. regular subscribers, who would provide steady revenue. 

A further analysis of bike repair and maintenance costs would be recommended as well as an analysis which took current Des Moines population statistics into account. 

The original data set was created from a much larger population center, as well as, a high tourist traffic area. However, the analysis showed the majority of business was generated from repeat users who utilized the service ostensibly for commuting so impact of potential tourist usage in the data should be weighted less heavily during investment consideration.
